There are yields for 4 different scenarii:
Set F: each mass ejects 0.07 Msun of Ni56
Set I: 13,15,20,25 Msun like set F – M>25 fully collapse in the remnant, only the wind is ejected
Set M: mixing and fall back [internal border fixed by [Ni/Fe]=0.2 – external border fixed at the base of the O shell (X(O)=0.001)] and then the mass cut is chosen again by requiring the ejection of 0.07 Msun of Ni56
Set R: 13,15,20,25 Msun like set M – M>25 fully collapse in the remnant, only the wind is ejected

For each set there are 19 files: 

the filenames ending with .nod refer to yields in which the unstable nuclei are allowed to decay only for the first 2e4 s after the explosion.
the filenames ending with .dec refer to yields in which the unstable nuclei are forced to fully decay to their closest stable daughter

filenames containing the word “iso” refer to the isotopic abundances
filenames containing the word “ele” refer to the elemental abundances

filenames containing the word “exp” refer to the final explosive yields
filenames containing the word “pre” refer to the pre explosive yields obtained by assuming the same mass cut of the explosive yields

filenames containing the word “yieldstot” refer to the total yields ejected.
filenames containing the word “yieldsnet” refer to the net yields, i.e. the total yields minus the initial amount

the two files tabwind contain only the contribution of the wind

Each file contains the yields – in solar masses - for all masses, metallicities and initial rotational velocity. Each evolution is identified by the sequence xxxmyyy
xxx stands for the mass, eg. 060 means 60 Msun.
m identifies the initial [Fe/H] = a(0), b(-1), c(-2) and d(-3).
yyy shows the initial rotational velocity, 000(non rotating), 150 (150 km/s) and 300 (300 km/s).

The two files, pfele and pfiso, contain the elemental and isotopic production factors for each mass, metallicity and initial rotational velocity

The three files yields_exp_ele_int.txt, yields_exp_iso_int.txt and yields_exp_iso_int.nod contain the yields integrated over a standard Salpeter IMF with x=1.35:
Each of these files has 39 columns:
ele, z, a, 12 production factors for the 4 metallicities and 3 rotational velocities, 12 integrated yields for the 4 metallicities and 3 rotational velocities, 8 columns to neglect, 4 columns with the initial chemical composition adopted for the four metallicities.
